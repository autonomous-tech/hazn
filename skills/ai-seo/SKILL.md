## AI Visibility Audit Process

### Step 1: Check AI Presence for Key Queries

Test 10-20 priority queries across platforms:

| Query | AI Overview? | ChatGPT Cites? | Perplexity Cites? | You Cited? | Competitors Cited? |
|-------|:-----------:|:--------------:|:-----------------:|:----------:|:------------------:|
| [query 1] | Y/N | Y/N | Y/N | Y/N | [who] |

**B2B query types to test:**
- "What is [your product category]?"
- "Best [category] for [enterprise/SMB/use case]"
- "[Your brand] vs [competitor]"
- "How to [problem your product solves]"
- "[Your category] pricing comparison"

### Step 2: Analyze Citation Patterns

When competitors get cited and client doesn't:
- **Content structure** — Is their content more extractable?
- **Authority signals** — More citations, stats, expert quotes?
- **Freshness** — More recently updated?
- **Schema markup** — Structured data you're missing?
- **Third-party presence** — Wikipedia, G2, industry publications?

### Step 3: Content Extractability Check

For each priority page, verify:

| Check | Pass/Fail |
|-------|-----------|
| Clear definition in first paragraph? | |
| Self-contained answer blocks (work without context)? | |
| Statistics with sources cited? | |
| Comparison tables for "[X] vs [Y]" queries? | |
| FAQ section with natural-language questions? | |
| Schema markup (FAQ, HowTo, Article, Product)? | |
| Expert attribution (author name, credentials)? | |
| Recently updated (within 6 months)? | |
| Headings match query patterns? | |
| AI bots allowed in robots.txt? | |

### Step 4: AI Bot Access Check

```bash
curl -sL "https://[domain]/robots.txt" | grep -iE "gptbot|chatgpt|perplexity|claude|anthropic|google-extended"
```

**Bots to allow for citation:**
- `GPTBot`, `ChatGPT-User` — ChatGPT
- `PerplexityBot` — Perplexity
- `ClaudeBot`, `anthropic-ai` — Claude
- `Google-Extended` — Gemini/AI Overviews
- `Bingbot` — Copilot

**Recommendation:** Allow these bots. Optionally block training-only crawlers like `CCBot`.

## The Three Pillars of AI SEO

### Pillar 1: Structure — Make Content Extractable

AI systems extract passages, not pages. Key claim must work standalone.

**Content block patterns:**
- **Definition blocks** for "What is X?" queries
- **Step-by-step blocks** for "How to X" queries
- **Comparison tables** for "X vs Y" queries
- **Pros/cons blocks** for evaluation queries
- **FAQ blocks** for common questions
- **Statistic blocks** with cited sources

**Structural rules:**
- Lead every section with direct answer (don't bury it)
- Key answer passages: 40-60 words (optimal for extraction)
- H2/H3 headings match how people phrase queries
- Tables beat prose for comparisons
- Numbered lists beat paragraphs for processes
- One clear idea per paragraph

### Pillar 2: Authority — Make Content Citable

**Princeton GEO Research (KDD 2024)** ranked optimization methods:

| Method | Visibility Boost | How to Apply |
|--------|:---------------:|--------------|
| **Cite sources** | +40% | Add authoritative references with links |
| **Add statistics** | +37% | Include specific numbers with sources |
| **Add quotations** | +30% | Expert quotes with name and title |
| **Authoritative tone** | +25% | Write with demonstrated expertise |
| **Improve clarity** | +20% | Simplify complex concepts |
| **Technical terms** | +18% | Use domain-specific terminology |
| ~~Keyword stuffing~~ | **-10%** | **Actively hurts AI visibility** |

**Best combination:** Fluency + Statistics = maximum boost.

**What builds citability:**
- Named authors with credentials
- Expert quotes with titles
- Statistics with cited sources and dates
- "Last updated: [date]" prominently displayed
- E-E-A-T signals (experience, expertise, authority, trust)

### Pillar 3: Presence — Be Where AI Looks

AI doesn't just cite your site — it cites where you appear.

**Third-party sources matter more than your own site:**
- Wikipedia mentions (7.8% of all ChatGPT citations)
- Reddit discussions (1.8% of ChatGPT citations)
- Industry publications (guest posts, mentions)
- Review sites (G2, Capterra for B2B SaaS)
- YouTube (frequently cited by AI Overviews)

**B2B actions:**
- Ensure Wikipedia page is accurate and current
- Maintain updated G2/Capterra profiles
- Get featured in industry roundups and comparison articles
- Create YouTube content for key how-to queries
- Publish on industry publications

## Schema Markup for AI

| Content Type | Schema | Why It Helps |
|-------------|--------|--------------|
| Articles/Blog | `Article`, `BlogPosting` | Author, date, topic ID |
| How-to content | `HowTo` | Step extraction |
| FAQs | `FAQPage` | Direct Q&A extraction |
| Products | `Product` | Pricing, features |
| Comparisons | `ItemList` | Structured comparison |
| Reviews | `Review`, `AggregateRating` | Trust signals |
| Organization | `Organization` | Entity recognition |

Content with proper schema shows 30-40% higher AI visibility.

---

## Content Types That Get Cited Most

| Content Type | Citation Share | Why AI Cites It |
|--------------|:-------------:|-----------------|
| **Comparison articles** | ~33% | Structured, balanced, high-intent |
| **Definitive guides** | ~15% | Comprehensive, authoritative |
| **Original research/data** | ~12% | Unique, citable statistics |
| **Best-of/listicles** | ~10% | Clear structure, entity-rich |
| **Product pages** | ~10% | Specific extractable details |
| **How-to guides** | ~8% | Step-by-step structure |

**What underperforms:**
- Generic blog posts without structure
- Thin product pages with marketing fluff
- Gated content (AI can't access it)
- Content without dates or author attribution
- PDF-only content
