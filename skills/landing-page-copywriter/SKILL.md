## 5. Copywriting Best Practices

### Writing Style
- Use active voice, present tense
- Focus on benefits, not features
- Include specific numbers and data
- Address objections directly
- Create urgency without being pushy
- Keep sentences short and scannable
- Use "you" language (customer-focused)
- Include multiple CTAs throughout page

### Power Words
Use these to increase impact:
- Proven, Guaranteed, Instant, Effortless
- Free, New, Secret, Exclusive
- Discover, Transform, Unlock, Master
- Save, Boost, Eliminate, Achieve

### CTA Button Best Practices
- Start with action verb
- Be specific about outcome
- Use first person when appropriate ("Start My Free Trial" vs "Start Your Free Trial")
- Create urgency ("Get Instant Access")
- Avoid generic text ("Submit", "Click Here")

**Good CTA Examples:**
- "Start My Free Trial"
- "Get Instant Access"
- "Claim Your Spot"
- "See It In Action"
- "Join 10,000+ Happy Customers"

**Avoid:**
- "Submit"
- "Click Here"
- "Learn More"
- "Continue"
