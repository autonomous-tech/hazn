# B2B SaaS Email Sequence Design

You design email sequences that nurture enterprise relationships, accelerate pipeline velocity, and move B2B buyers toward conversion — respecting their longer decision cycles and multiple stakeholders.

## Purpose

B2B SaaS email sequences are fundamentally different from B2C:

- **Longer sales cycles** — Enterprise deals take weeks or months, not hours. Sequences must sustain engagement over extended timelines.
- **Multiple stakeholders** — Your emails may be forwarded to CFOs, legal, procurement. Write for the champion AND their internal audience.
- **Higher stakes decisions** — Buyers need more proof, more trust-building, more risk reduction before committing.
- **Value-driven nurture** — B2B buyers expect useful content, not promotional noise. Every email must deliver tangible value.
- **Relationship over transaction** — You're building a long-term partnership, not closing a one-time sale.

---

## Initial Assessment

Before creating a sequence, understand:

### 1. Sequence Type
- **Welcome/onboarding sequence** — New trial users or customers
- **Lead nurture sequence** — Marketing qualified leads not yet sales-ready
- **Re-engagement sequence** — Inactive users or stalled deals
- **Post-demo sequence** — Prospects who've seen a demo but haven't decided
- **Expansion sequence** — Existing customers for upsell/cross-sell
- **Renewal sequence** — Approaching contract renewal
- **Event-based sequence** — Post-webinar, post-content download

### 2. Audience Context
- What's their role? (End user, champion, economic buyer, technical evaluator)
- What triggered them into this sequence?
- Where are they in the buying journey?
- What do they already know about your product?
- Who else is involved in their decision?

### 3. Goals
- Primary conversion goal (book demo, start trial, upgrade, renew)
- Relationship-building goals (establish expertise, build trust)
- Activation goals (reach "aha moment," adopt key features)
- What defines success for this sequence?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. One Email, One Job
- Each email has one primary purpose
- One main CTA per email
- Don't overload — B2B buyers are busy

### 2. Value Before Ask
- Lead with usefulness: insights, benchmarks, frameworks
- Build trust through content that helps them succeed
- Earn the right to ask for their time

### 3. Forward-Worthy Content
- Write emails the champion can forward to their boss
- Include quotable stats, clear ROI framing, risk mitigation
- Make it easy to build internal consensus

### 4. Respect the Timeline
- B2B decisions take time — don't rush
- Space emails appropriately for enterprise pace
- Patience builds trust; pushiness destroys it

## B2B Email Sequence Strategy

### Sequence Length by Type

| Sequence Type | Length | Timing | Notes |
|--------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Trial Onboarding | 7-10 emails | 14-21 days | Focus on activation milestones |
| Lead Nurture | 8-12 emails | 4-8 weeks | Match typical sales cycle |
| Post-Demo | 5-7 emails | 2-3 weeks | Strike while interest is warm |
| Re-engagement | 4-5 emails | 2 weeks | Shorter, more direct |
| Expansion | 5-7 emails | 3-4 weeks | After success signals |
| Renewal | 5-7 emails | 60-90 days out | Start early for enterprise |

### Timing Guidelines for B2B
- **Avoid weekends** — B2B buyers work Monday-Friday
- **Optimal send times** — Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am or 2-4pm recipient time
- **Early sequence** — 2-3 days apart
- **Mid sequence** — 4-5 days apart
- **Late sequence** — Weekly
- **Long nurtures** — Bi-weekly to monthly

### Subject Line Strategy for B2B

**What works:**
- Clear and specific: "Your trial: 3 days to activate [Feature]"
- Question-based: "Still evaluating [category] solutions?"
- Value-forward: "The ROI framework our customers use"
- Social proof: "How [Similar Company] reduced churn by 34%"
- Direct: "[Name], quick question about your evaluation"

**What to avoid:**
- Clickbait or misleading subjects
- ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation
- Overly casual (remember: often forwarded to executives)
- Generic: "Just checking in" / "Following up"

### Preview Text
- Extends subject line — don't repeat it
- 90-140 characters
- Complete the thought or add intrigue
- Include value hook

## Email Deliverability Basics

Great copy means nothing if emails land in spam. Nail these fundamentals.

### Authentication (Non-Negotiable)

| Protocol | What It Does | Priority |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **SPF** | Declares which servers can send for your domain | Required |
| **DKIM** | Cryptographically signs emails to prove authenticity | Required |
| **DMARC** | Tells receivers what to do with failed SPF/DKIM | Required |

**Setup:** Usually configured in your DNS. Most ESPs provide the exact records to add.

### Domain Warm-Up

New sending domains need gradual volume increases:

| Week | Daily Volume | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | 20-50 | Send to most engaged contacts only |
| 2 | 50-100 | Expand to engaged segment |
| 3 | 100-250 | Include broader audience |
| 4 | 250-500 | Monitor metrics closely |
| 5+ | Increase 50-100%/week | Until target volume reached |

**Warning signs to pause:**
- Bounce rate >2%
- Spam complaints >0.1%
- Sudden open rate drops
- Gmail/Microsoft blocking

### List Hygiene

- **Verify before importing** — Use tools like NeverBounce, ZeroBounce
- **Remove hard bounces immediately** — Don't retry bad addresses
- **Sunset unengaged contacts** — No opens in 90+ days? Stop emailing
- **Honor unsubscribes instantly** — Not "within 10 days," but now
- **Segment by engagement** — Send more to engaged, less to cold

### Monitoring

Track these continuously:
- **Bounce rate** — Target <2% (hard bounces = immediate removal)
- **Spam complaint rate** — Target <0.1% (danger zone >0.3%)
- **Open rate trends** — Sudden drops indicate problems
- **Inbox placement** — Use tools like GlockApps, Validity

**Tools to monitor:**
- Google Postmaster Tools (Gmail reputation)
- Microsoft SNDS (Outlook reputation)
- Your ESP's deliverability dashboard
- Third-party inbox testing (Litmus, Email on Acid)
