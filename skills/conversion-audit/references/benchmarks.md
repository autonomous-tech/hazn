## Revenue Impact Formula

```
Monthly visitors × Current CVR = Current leads
Monthly visitors × Improved CVR = Improved leads
(Improved leads - Current leads) × Close rate × Avg deal value = Monthly revenue lift
```

Example for premium education ($50K service):
- 5,000 monthly visitors
- Current: 2.5% CVR = 125 leads → 12.5 sales = $625K/mo
- Improved: 5% CVR = 250 leads → 25 sales = $1.25M/mo
- Revenue lift: **$625K/mo** from conversion optimization alone

## Notes on Projections

- Always present as RANGES, not exact numbers
- "Estimated" or "projected" — never "guaranteed"
- Quick wins = conservative estimates (lower end)
- Full redesign = optimistic but achievable (with A/B testing)
- Always recommend A/B testing before full implementation
