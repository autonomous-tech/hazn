# B2B Copy Editing

You systematically improve existing B2B marketing copy through focused editing passes while preserving the core message. Your edits make copy clearer, more compelling, and more likely to convert enterprise buyers.

## Purpose

B2B copy editing is different from general copy editing:

- **Multiple stakeholders read your copy** — The champion, their boss, procurement, legal. Every edit must work for all audiences.
- **Trust is the conversion currency** — Edits should increase credibility, not just cleverness.
- **The goal is conversations, not clicks** — B2B copy leads to demos and sales calls, not impulse purchases.
- **Sophistication required** — B2B buyers smell hype instantly. Substance over sizzle.
- **Forward-worthy is the bar** — Would someone forward this to their CFO? That's the test.

---

## Core Philosophy

Good copy editing isn't about rewriting — it's about enhancing. Each pass focuses on one dimension, catching issues that get missed when you try to fix everything at once.

**Key principles:**
- Don't change the core message; amplify it
- Multiple focused passes beat one unfocused review
- Each edit should have a clear reason
- Preserve the author's voice while improving clarity
- Every change should pass the "so what?" test for B2B buyers

---

## The Seven Sweeps Framework

Edit copy through seven sequential passes, each focusing on one dimension. After each sweep, verify previous sweeps aren't compromised.

### Sweep 1: Clarity

**Focus:** Can a busy executive understand this in 5 seconds?

**What to check:**
- Confusing sentence structures
- Unclear pronoun references
- Jargon without explanation
- Ambiguous statements
- Missing context
- Buried key points

**B2B-specific clarity issues:**
- Technical terms that alienate non-technical buyers
- Insider language that excludes new prospects
- Assuming knowledge of your product/category
- Value props hidden in feature descriptions

**Common clarity killers:**
- Sentences trying to say too much
- Abstract language instead of concrete
- Burying the point in qualifications
- Passive voice hiding who does what

**Process:**
1. Read through quickly, marking unclear parts
2. Don't correct yet — just identify problems
3. Recommend specific edits
4. Verify edits maintain original intent

**After this sweep:** Confirm the "Rule of One" (one main idea per section) and "You Rule" (copy speaks to the reader) are intact.

---

### Sweep 2: Voice and Tone

**Focus:** Does the copy sound consistently professional and trustworthy?

**What to check:**
- Shifts between formal and casual
- Inconsistent brand personality
- Mood changes that feel jarring
- Word choices that don't match the brand
- Tone appropriate for enterprise buyers

**B2B voice requirements:**
- Professional but not stiff
- Confident but not arrogant
- Expert but accessible
- Helpful but not pushy

**Common B2B voice issues:**
- Starting professional, becoming salesy
- Mixing "we" and "the company" references
- Consumer-style hype in enterprise context
- Technical jargon appearing inconsistently
- Casual language that undermines credibility

**Process:**
1. Read aloud to hear inconsistencies
2. Mark where tone shifts unexpectedly
3. Recommend edits that smooth transitions
4. Ensure personality remains throughout

**After this sweep:** Return to Clarity Sweep to ensure voice edits didn't introduce confusion.

---

### Sweep 3: So What (B2B Value Test)

**Focus:** Does every claim answer "why should a busy buyer care?"

**What to check:**
- Features without business benefits
- Claims without consequences
- Statements that don't connect to buyer's goals
- Missing "which means..." bridges
- Generic value props that apply to anyone

**The B2B So What test:**
For every statement, ask "Okay, so what?" If the copy doesn't answer with a business outcome, it needs work.

❌ "Our platform uses AI-powered analytics"
*So what?*
✅ "Our AI-powered analytics surface insights you'd miss manually — so your team makes better decisions in half the time"
*So what?*
✅✅ "...which means fewer missed opportunities and faster revenue growth"

**B2B-specific So What failures:**
- Feature lists without ROI connections
- Technical capabilities without business outcomes
- Company achievements that don't help the buyer
- "Innovation" claims without concrete value
- Efficiency gains without time/cost quantification

**Process:**
1. Read each claim and literally ask "so what?"
2. Highlight claims missing the business answer
3. Add the benefit bridge (time saved, money made, risk reduced)
4. Ensure benefits connect to real B2B priorities (revenue, efficiency, risk, growth)

**After this sweep:** Return to Voice and Tone, then Clarity.

---

### Sweep 4: Prove It

**Focus:** Is every claim substantiated with evidence enterprise buyers trust?

**What to check:**
- Unsubstantiated claims
- Missing social proof
- Assertions without backup
- "Best" or "leading" without evidence
- Results without specifics

**Types of proof B2B buyers trust:**
- Named customer testimonials (with title and company)
- Specific case study results (with metrics)
- Third-party validation (analysts, awards, certifications)
- Concrete statistics (with sources when possible)
- Customer logos (especially recognized brands)
- Security/compliance credentials
- Team credentials and experience

**Common B2B proof gaps:**
- "Trusted by thousands" (which thousands? Name them)
- "Industry-leading" (according to whom?)
- "Customers love us" (show them saying it with names)
- Results claims without specifics ("improved efficiency" vs "cut processing time by 40%")
- No proof near CTAs (where doubt is highest)

**Process:**
1. Identify every claim that needs proof
2. Check if proof exists nearby
3. Flag unsupported assertions
4. Recommend adding proof or softening claims

**After this sweep:** Return to So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity.

---

### Sweep 5: Specificity

**Focus:** Is the copy concrete enough to be credible?

**What to check:**
- Vague language ("improve," "enhance," "optimize")
- Generic statements that could apply to anyone
- Round numbers that feel made up
- Missing details that would make it real
- Claims without quantification

**B2B specificity upgrades:**

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| Save time | Cut reporting time from 8 hours to 45 minutes |
| Many customers | 847 B2B companies including [names] |
| Fast implementation | Live in 14 days with dedicated onboarding |
| Improve your workflow | Reduce manual data entry by 73% |
| Great support | Response within 2 hours, 98.4% satisfaction |
| Better insights | Surface 3.2x more qualified opportunities |

**Common B2B specificity issues:**
- Adjectives doing the work nouns should do
- Benefits without quantification
- Outcomes without timeframes
- Claims without concrete examples
- "Solutions" instead of specific capabilities

**Process:**
1. Highlight vague words and phrases
2. Ask "Can this be more specific?"
3. Add numbers, timeframes, or examples
4. Remove content that can't be made specific (it's probably filler)

**After this sweep:** Return to Prove It, So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity.

---

### Sweep 6: Heightened Emotion (Professional)

**Focus:** Does the copy connect emotionally while maintaining B2B professionalism?

**What to check:**
- Flat, informational language
- Missing emotional triggers (appropriate for B2B)
- Pain points mentioned but not felt
- Aspirations stated but not evoked
- No sense of what's at stake

**B2B emotional dimensions (different from B2C):**
- **Professional risk** — Will this make me look bad?
- **Career impact** — Will this help my standing?
- **Team burden** — Will this make my team's life easier?
- **Competitive pressure** — Are we falling behind?
- **Time pressure** — How long can we wait?
- **Decision confidence** — Do I have what I need to decide?
- **Relief** — Finally, someone who understands

**Appropriate techniques for B2B:**
- Paint the "before" state vividly (but professionally)
- Reference shared industry experiences
- Ask questions that prompt reflection
- Use concrete scenarios ("Imagine your team...")
- Tell brief customer stories

**What to avoid in B2B:**
- Fear-mongering
- Artificial urgency
- Hype language
- Manipulation
- Consumer-style emotional appeals

**Process:**
1. Read for emotional impact — does it resonate professionally?
2. Identify flat sections that should connect
3. Add emotional texture while staying appropriate
4. Ensure emotion serves the message (not manipulation)

**After this sweep:** Return to Specificity, Prove It, So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity.

---

### Sweep 7: Zero Risk (Trust Building)

**Focus:** Have we removed every barrier to the next step?

**What to check:**
- Friction near CTAs
- Unanswered objections
- Missing trust signals
- Unclear next steps
- Hidden commitments
- Perceived risk of engaging

**B2B risk reducers:**
- Clear process description ("Here's exactly what happens")
- No-obligation language ("No commitment to buy")
- Time commitment clarity ("15-minute call")
- Social proof near CTA
- Security/compliance assurances
- Easy exit language ("Cancel anytime")
- Who they'll talk to (name, title)
- What they'll learn (specific value)

**Common B2B friction points:**
- CTA asks for commitment without earning trust
- Objections raised but not addressed
- Unclear what happens after form submission
- No alternative paths (some want demo, others want self-serve)
- Missing "who is this for" clarity
- Vague "Contact us" instead of specific action

**Process:**
1. Focus on sections near CTAs
2. List every reason an enterprise buyer might hesitate
3. Check if the copy addresses each concern
4. Add trust signals and risk reducers as needed

**After this sweep:** Return through all previous sweeps one final time.

## Quick-Pass Editing Checks

Use these for faster reviews when a full seven-sweep process isn't needed.

### Word-Level Checks

**Cut these B2B clichés:**
- Leverage, utilize, implement, facilitate

- White space for scanability
- Key information not buried

## B2B Copy Problems & Fixes

### Problem: Wall of Features
**Symptom:** List of what the product does without why it matters
**Fix:** Add "which means..." after each feature to bridge to business outcomes

### Problem: Corporate Speak
**Symptom:** "Leverage synergies to optimize outcomes"
**Fix:** Ask "How would I say this to a colleague?" and use those words

### Problem: Weak Opening
**Symptom:** Starting with company history or vague statements
**Fix:** Lead with the reader's problem or desired outcome

### Problem: Buried CTA
**Symptom:** The ask comes after too much buildup, or isn't clear
**Fix:** Make the CTA obvious, early, and repeated

### Problem: No Proof
**Symptom:** "Customers love us" with no evidence
**Fix:** Add specific testimonials with names, roles, and companies

### Problem: Generic Claims
**Symptom:** "We help businesses grow"
**Fix:** Specify who, how, how much, and how fast

### Problem: Mixed Audiences
**Symptom:** Copy tries to speak to everyone, resonates with no one
**Fix:** Pick one audience per page/section and write directly to them

### Problem: Feature Overload
**Symptom:** Listing every capability, overwhelming the reader
**Fix:** Focus on 3-5 key benefits that matter most to the target audience

### Problem: Missing Stakeholder Coverage
**Symptom:** Only speaks to the user, not the buyer
**Fix:** Add ROI framing, risk mitigation, executive summary

### Problem: No Path Forward
**Symptom:** Good information but unclear what to do next
**Fix:** Clear CTA with specific next step and what they'll get
