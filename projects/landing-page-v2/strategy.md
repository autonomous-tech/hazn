# Hazn Landing Page Strategy
*Version 2.0 | Waitlist Launch*

---

## 1. Positioning Statement

**For technical founders and marketing leaders who can build anything but struggle to market it,** Hazn is an **AI marketing framework** that **turns your coding assistant into a team of 10 specialized marketing agents** — unlike hiring, agencies, or generic AI tools that either cost $15K+/month, take weeks to onboard, or produce generic garbage.

### Compressed Tagline Options:
- "Your coding assistant. Now a marketing team."
- "10 marketing agents. Zero marketing hires."
- "Ship marketing like you ship code."

---

## 2. Key Messages (What They Must Believe)

### Message 1: Marketing agents, not marketing prompts
Hazn isn't another AI writing tool. It's 10 specialized agents — Strategist, Copywriter, SEO Specialist, Developer — that work together like a real marketing team. Each has deep expertise. They hand work to each other. The output is actually usable.

### Message 2: Built for builders
If you can use Claude Code, Cursor, or any coding assistant — you already know how to use Hazn. No new app. No learning curve. Just type `/website` and your marketing team gets to work.

### Message 3: Agency-quality, fraction of the cost
What takes an agency 6 weeks and $30K, Hazn ships in hours. Not because it cuts corners — because it eliminates the coordination tax, the client calls, the revisions ping-pong.

### Message 4: Created by operators who felt your pain
Abdullah & Rizwan spent 35 years building products. Marketing was always the bottleneck. They didn't hire. They built the team they wished existed.

### Message 5: Early access = shape the product
First 100 users aren't customers — they're co-creators. Direct Slack access to founders. Your feedback becomes features.

## 3. Target Persona Deep-Dives

### Persona A: Head of Marketing / CMO
**Title:** VP Marketing, Head of Growth, CMO at Series A-C startup

**Pain Points:**
- Team of 3-5 can't keep up with content demands
- Agencies deliver mediocre work, charge $15-30K/month
- Freelancers are inconsistent and need constant management
- Always fighting for more headcount, rarely getting it
- CEO asks "why can't we just use AI?" and they don't have a good answer

**What They've Tried:**
- Jasper, Copy.ai — outputs sound generic, need heavy editing
- ChatGPT — useful for brainstorming, not production
- Agencies — quality varies wildly, expensive
- Upwork freelancers — management overhead kills ROI

**Why Hazn Is Different:**
- Not a single tool — it's a coordinated team of specialists
- Outputs are production-ready, not drafts
- Integrates into engineering workflow (no new tools to adopt)
- Makes their existing team 10x more productive

**Objections:**
1. "AI can't replace senior marketing thinking" → Response: It doesn't. It handles the 80% that's execution so your team can focus on strategy.
2. "We've tried AI tools, they don't work" → Response: You've tried copilots. This is a crew. Show the workflow.
3. "My CEO will want to cut my team" → Response: No — you'll ship 10x more, prove marketing's value, and justify expansion.

**Overcome With:** Demo that shows strategic depth (not just content generation). Emphasize "augment, not replace."

---

### Persona B: Marketing Agency Principal
**Title:** Agency Owner, Partner, Director at 10-50 person shop

**Pain Points:**
- Junior talent shortage — can't find good writers, SEOs
- Client margins getting squeezed
- AI tools exist but aren't reliable enough for client work
- Competitors claiming AI capabilities, need to keep up
- Revenue per employee stuck — need leverage

**What They've Tried:**
- Various AI writing tools — too much QC needed
- Hiring offshore — quality and communication issues
- Productizing services — hard to scale delivery

**Why Hazn Is Different:**
- Quality bar is agency-level (built by people who've run agencies)
- Lets senior strategists leverage AI without junior staff
- Same team = consistent quality across clients
- White-labelable workflow

**Objections:**
1. "Clients will figure out we're using AI" → Response: Clients don't care how the sausage is made. They care about results. The best agencies will use this.
2. "My team won't adopt this" → Response: If they can use Claude/Cursor, they can use Hazn. It's the same interface.
3. "What about our proprietary processes?" → Response: Hazn is a framework — customize the agents, add your own skills.

**Overcome With:** Economics story. "What if you could take on 3x the clients with the same team?" Case study format.

---

### Persona C: Technical Founder
**Title:** Solo founder, technical co-founder at pre-seed/seed startup

**Pain Points:**
- Can build anything but struggles to explain why anyone should care
- Marketing feels like a foreign language
- Can't afford to hire ($120K+ for a decent marketer)
- Tried agencies, felt like burning money
- Landing pages, content, SEO — all important, all neglected

**What They've Tried:**
- DIY with ChatGPT — okay for drafts, nothing production-ready
- Fiverr/Upwork — inconsistent, lots of management
- Reading marketing books — good theory, no execution
- Templates — feel generic, hard to customize

**Why Hazn Is Different:**
- Works where they already work (Claude Code, Cursor)
- No marketing expertise needed — just describe what you're building
- From idea to published landing page in one command
- Founder story: "We were you. We built this for ourselves."

**Objections:**
1. "I don't have time to learn another tool" → Response: Zero learning curve if you use a coding assistant. It's just new commands.
2. "I'm not sure if I'm doing marketing right" → Response: The agents have the expertise. You just need to describe your product.
3. "AI content won't rank/convert" → Response: Show examples. SEO agent does real keyword research. Copy agent follows conversion best practices.

**Overcome With:** Speed demo. "Type `/landing` and watch." Make it feel like a superpower, not a chore.

---

### Persona D: Growth Team at Scale-up
**Title:** Growth Lead, Growth PM, Marketing Manager at 50-500 employee company

**Pain Points:**
- Always waiting on content, creative, development
- Experiment velocity limited by production capacity
- Politics between marketing and engineering
- Lots of ideas, not enough bandwidth to test them
- Dashboards everywhere but can't ship fast enough to learn

**What They've Tried:**
- Internal tools — half-built, unmaintained
- Agency retainers — slow turnaround, expensive
- Hiring contractors — management overhead
- AI tools — useful for ideation, not production

**Why Hazn Is Different:**
- Ship experiments faster without more headcount
- Works in engineering's workflow (not another marketing tool to maintain)
- From hypothesis to live test in hours, not weeks
- Consistency across experiments (same agents = learnable patterns)

**Objections:**
1. "Our brand guidelines are complex" → Response: Train the agents on your brand. They learn your voice, your rules.
2. "We need design, not just copy" → Response: Hazn ships HTML/CSS. Wireframer agent, Developer agent. Full pages.
3. "Legal needs to approve everything" → Response: Faster first drafts = more time for review. Agents can learn compliance rules.

**Overcome With:** Velocity story. "What would change if you could test 10 ideas this week instead of 2 this month?"

## 5. Messaging Hierarchy

### Tier 1: Hero Message (First 5 seconds)
**Direction:** The transformation statement

**Headline Options (test these):**
- "Your coding assistant. Now a marketing team."
- "10 marketing agents. One command."
- "Ship marketing like you ship code."
- "The marketing team that runs on `/slash`."

**Why this works:** Immediately communicates the core value prop. Targets builders. Creates intrigue.

### Tier 2: Support (Next 30 seconds)
**The capability stack:**

1. **"22 specialized skills. 6 workflows. 10 agents."** — Establishes scope and sophistication
2. **"Works where you work."** — Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf. Zero new tools.
3. **"From strategy to shipped."** — Not just content. Full landing pages, SEO-optimized, production-ready.

### Tier 3: Proof (Convince the skeptics)
**Credibility layer:**

1. **"Built by operators who felt your pain."** — 35 years building products, marketing was always the bottleneck
2. **"100s of websites and apps later..."** — Track record. Not theorists.
3. **Early access exclusivity** — "First 100 users shape the product"

### Messaging Flow on Page:
```
Hero: "Your coding assistant. Now a marketing team."
Subhead: "10 AI agents that actually ship marketing — from strategy to production."
Social proof: "From the team behind [X products] at Autonomous"
CTA: "Join the waitlist"
```

---

## 6. Social Proof Strategy

### Pre-Launch Credibility Stack

**1. Founder Credentials**
- "35 years combined tech experience"
- "Built 100s of websites and apps"
- Link to Autonomous portfolio (show, don't tell)

**2. "Built by Operators" Angle**
- **Story:** "Marketing was always the hard part. We spent years figuring it out. Then AI agents came along and we thought — why not just build marketing agents?"
- **Frame:** We're not VCs or consultants. We're builders who needed this ourselves.

**3. Technical Sophistication**
- "Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Clawdbot"
- Integration with respected tools = borrowed credibility
- "22 skills, 6 workflows, 10 agents" — specificity = believability

**4. Waitlist Psychology as Social Proof**
- Show waitlist count after ~50 signups
- "Join 127 founders, CMOs, and agency leaders"
- If known names sign up, ask permission to feature

**5. Early User Testimonials (if available)**
- Even DMs or Slack messages work
- "This is what I've been looking for" — [Name], Founder at [Company]
- Video testimonials are gold but not required for v1

**6. Build in Public**
- Changelog / updates shared with waitlist
- "See what we shipped this week"
- Creates investment before launch

---

## 7. Waitlist Psychology

### The 4 Levers

#### 1. Scarcity (Real, Not Manufactured)
- **"First 100 users get founder access"** — Direct line to Abdullah & Rizwan
- **"Onboarding limited to 20/week at launch"** — We want quality, not chaos
- **"Pricing increases after early access ends"** — Standard, works

**Why this works:** Real constraints. We genuinely can't onboard 1000 people well in week one.

#### 2. Exclusivity (Make Them Feel Chosen)
- **"Built for people who can build products"** — Not for everyone
- **"Designed for Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf users"** — Technical bar
- **"If you've felt the pain of shipping great products with mediocre marketing — this is for you."** — Identity-based selection

**Why this works:** People want to be part of something selective. Filters also improve quality of waitlist.

#### 3. Early Access Benefits (Make Waiting Worth It)
- **"Lock in founding member pricing"** — Specific: "$X/month forever"
- **"Shape the roadmap"** — Your feedback becomes features
- **"Private community access"** — Slack/Discord with other early users
- **"Extended trial"** — 60 days instead of 14

**Why this works:** Tangible benefits beyond "you get it first."

#### 4. FOMO Triggers (Strategic Urgency)
- **Show activity:** "23 people joined today"
- **Show scarcity:** "14 founding member spots left"
- **Show momentum:** Weekly email updates with progress, waitlist growth
- **Show insider info:** "Here's what we're building this week" (builds investment)

**Why this works:** Social proof + progress = irresistible curiosity.

### Waitlist Page Elements:

```
[Hero + Subhead]
[Email input + CTA: "Join the waitlist"]
[Trust line: "No spam. Updates every 2 weeks. Unsubscribe anytime."]

[After submit - Confirmation page:]
"You're in. #247 on the waitlist."
"We're onboarding in batches starting [Month]."
"In the meantime:"
- [Follow us on X]
- [Tell a founder who needs this → Share link]
- [Read how we're building Hazn → Blog link]

[Referral program if possible]
"Move up the list. 3 referrals = priority access."
```

## 8. Summary: The Strategic Narrative

### One-Liner
Hazn turns your coding assistant into a marketing team of 10 specialized AI agents.

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"If you're a founder or marketer who's great at building but struggles to market — you've probably tried AI tools, agencies, or doing it yourself. None of it works well. Hazn is different: it's 10 AI agents that work as a coordinated marketing team, right inside your coding workflow. Strategy, copy, SEO, development — all production-ready. Built by two operators with 35 years experience who got tired of marketing being the bottleneck."

### The Origin Story (Use in About / Emails)
"Abdullah and Rizwan have built 100s of websites and apps over 35 years. Marketing was always the hard part — finding good agencies, hiring the right people, managing freelancers. They spent years figuring it out. Then AI agents came along, and they thought: why not just build the marketing team we always wished we had? That's Hazn. 10 specialized agents. One framework. Built for people like us — who can build anything, but need help telling the world about it."

## Appendix: Key Decisions & Rationale

1. **Primary audience = Technical founders** — Even though CMOs have budget, founders have urgency and will become word-of-mouth engines.

2. **"Marketing team" framing > "AI tool"** — Team implies coordination, expertise, depth. Tool implies prompting.

3. **Leaning into "coding assistant" integration** — Differentiator vs. every other AI marketing tool. No new app = real adoption.

4. **Specificity (22 skills, 6 workflows, 10 agents)** — Concrete numbers build credibility. Vague claims don't.

5. **Waitlist exclusivity = quality control** — Not false scarcity. Real: we want engaged users who give feedback, not tourists.
