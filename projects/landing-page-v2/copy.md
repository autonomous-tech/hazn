## 2. PROBLEM SECTION

**Eyebrow:** Sound familiar?

**Headline:** You Can Build Anything. Marketing Is Still the Bottleneck.

**Pain Points:**

**1. AI tools produce generic garbage.**
You've tried ChatGPT, Jasper, Copy.ai. The output needs so much editing it would have been faster to write from scratch. Good enough for brainstorming. Useless for production.

**2. Agencies cost $15K+/month and move at their pace.**
You're paying for account managers, strategy decks, and revision rounds. Half the budget goes to coordination, not execution. And they still don't understand your product.

**3. Hiring takes forever. Good marketers are expensive.**
$120K+ for someone decent. Three months to ramp up. One person with limited skills. And they want equity.

**4. Your team is stretched too thin.**
Engineers ship features in days. Marketing ships a landing page in weeks. The backlog grows. Competitors launch. Pipeline suffers.

## 3. SOLUTION SECTION

**Eyebrow:** A different approach

**Headline:** Not Another AI Tool. A Coordinated Marketing Team.

**Body:**
Hazn is 10 specialized AI agents that work together like a senior marketing team. Strategist, Copywriter, SEO Specialist, UX Architect, Developer. Each has deep expertise in their domain. They hand work to each other. The output is production-ready, not a rough draft.

**How the agents work:**
- The **Strategist** builds your positioning and competitive analysis
- The **Copywriter** writes conversion-focused copy that sounds like you
- The **SEO Specialist** does real keyword research and optimization
- The **Developer** ships actual HTML/CSS you can deploy

**Key Differentiator:**
ChatGPT is a smart intern. Hazn is a senior marketing team that has worked together for years. You describe your product. They coordinate and ship.

## 4. HOW IT WORKS

**Eyebrow:** The process

## 6. FOUNDER STORY

**Eyebrow:** Why we built this

**Headline:** 35 Years of Building. Marketing Was Always the Hard Part.

**Body (70 words):**
We're Abdullah and Rizwan from Autonomous. We've built 100s of websites and apps over the past 35 years. Marketing was always the bottleneck. We tried agencies, freelancers, doing it ourselves. Nothing worked well. Then AI agents came along and we thought: why not just build the marketing team we always wished we had? So we did. Hazn is that team.
