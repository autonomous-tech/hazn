# Development Progress

## Workflow: /hazn-landing
**Target:** Hazn landing page (dogfood)
**Started:** 2026-02-16

## Completed Phases

- [x] Brief — `.hazn/outputs/landing-brief.md`
- [x] Page Structure — `.hazn/outputs/landing-blueprint.md`
- [x] Copy — `.hazn/outputs/copy/landing.md`
- [x] Build — Single-file HTML (deployed to rizqaiser.com/hazn)

## Implementation Notes

**Stack:** Single HTML file (static, no CMS needed for v1)
**Styling:** Inline CSS with Tailwind-like utilities
**Icons:** Lucide SVG icons (inline)
**Fonts:** Inter + JetBrains Mono (Google Fonts)

## Deviations from Standard Workflow

- Skipped wireframe phase (fast path)
- Single HTML instead of Next.js (appropriate for simple landing)
- No CMS (content is static for launch)

## Output

**Live URL:** https://rizqaiser.com/hazn
**Source:** /home/rizki/rizqaiser.com/hazn/index.html

## Meta

This landing page was built by following the Hazn `/hazn-landing` workflow.
The page itself is proof that the workflow works.
